  <p>My first step that I did to create my favicon was to think about my design and use black and white first to visualize my design. After that, I started to color in the picture that I wanted to make my favicon, which is in my case, a teddy bear with a heart. By using a reference side by side, I used a 32 by 32-pixel canvas to create my design. After I was finished with my design, I made a PDF file with the design. With that PDF file, I then took a screenshot of my teddy bear and then downloaded and saved the file to my computer as "tanishateddybear.png" and transported the file to Replit for my webpage. All that was left was to code the file into my webpage. I used the tags that are used to code a Favicon under my title tag. Finally, my favicon was complete.</p>
  <!--I learned that It is very easy to create a favicon and very fun and that next time when I need to make one, I need to convert a PDF file to a PNG file for it to compute.-->
